# AI Assisted Transfer Evaluation Tool

![UW Transfer Evaluation Tool](public/UW_Transfer_Evaluation_Tool.jpg)

A web-based prototype demonstrating an AI-powered system for evaluating transfer credits at the University of Washington. This project was developed as part of the INFO 200 (Introduction to Informatics) final prototype assignment.

## Course Context

**Course:** INFO 200 - Introduction to Informatics
**Institution:** University of Washington
**Project Type:** Final Prototype Demonstration

This is a student demo project created to explore how technology can improve the transfer student experience through better credit evaluation systems.

## Problem Overview

Transfer students face significant challenges when navigating the credit evaluation process:

- **Confusing Systems:** Current transfer equivalency systems are inefficient and difficult to navigate
- **Lack of Clarity:** Students struggle to understand which courses transfer and how credits apply
- **Time-Consuming Process:** Repetitive emails and advisor appointments create barriers for students
- **Limited Information:** Out-of-state students often can't find their courses in existing equivalency guides
- **Uncertainty:** Students feel lost without clear guidance on their academic progress

These issues create unnecessary stress for transfer students and place additional burden on academic advisors.

## Our Solution

An AI-assisted transfer evaluation tool that streamlines the credit evaluation process by:

- **Automatic Transcript Analysis:** Upload unofficial transcripts and receive instant course matching
- **Clear Transfer Reports:** Visual reports showing which courses transfer directly, count as electives, or need advisor review
- **AI-Powered Matching:** Intelligent course comparison using existing transfer databases and course syllabi
- **Guided Experience:** Step-by-step process with clear explanations at every stage
- **FERPA Compliance:** Transparent data usage with required consent before processing

## Key Features

### Primary Features
- **Automatic Transcript Analysis:** AI reads and matches courses with UW equivalents
- **Visual Transfer Report:** Downloadable reports highlighting direct transfers, electives, and courses needing review
- **Credit Summary:** Quick overview of total credits, transferable credits, and missing requirements

### Secondary Features
- **Advisor Request System:** Generate ready-to-send review requests for courses needing clarification
- **Course Description Retrieval:** Automatic lookup of course details when transcripts only include course codes
- **Dashboard:** Track multiple evaluations and manage account settings
